# Description

In this project, I will be doing a climate analysis on Honolulu, HI in order to analyze the weather during a desired vacation time in the past. 

# Features & Libraries:

Python
SQLAlchemy (ORM queries)
Pandas
Matplotlib

## My Process 

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

## Climate App

* Design a Flask API based on the queries that I have just developed.
